            <br />
            <p>In this blog post, we'll dive into the world of access tokens and refresh tokens, demystifying their roles, how they work, and where you should store them on the client-side. Additionally, we'll explore two popular JavaScript frameworks for building web applications: Express.js and Nest.js.</p>

            <h2 className='text-2xl'>Access Tokens and Refresh Tokens:</h2>
            <br />
            <h2 className='text-xl'>What is an Access Token?</h2>
            <br />
            <p className='text-md'>An access token is a string that represents the right to access resources on behalf of a user or application. It is commonly used in OAuth 2.0 authentication protocols and is typically short-lived. Access tokens provide a secure way to grant limited access to specific resources without exposing the user's credentials.</p>
            <br />
            <h2 className='text-xl'>How do Access Tokens work?</h2>
            <br />
            <p className='text-md'> When a user or application authenticates, they receive an access token from the authentication server. This token is sent with every request to protected resources. The server receiving the token validates it and grants access to the requested resource if the token is valid.</p>
            <br />
            <h2 className='text-xl'>What is a Refresh Token?</h2>
            <br />
            <p className='text-md'>A refresh token is a long-lived credential that can be used to obtain a new access token. While access tokens expire relatively quickly for security reasons, refresh tokens can be used to request new access tokens without the need for the user to re-enter their credentials.</p>
            <br />
            <h2 className='text-xl'>How do Refresh Tokens work?</h2>
            <br />
            <p className='text-md'>When an access token expires, the client can use a refresh token to request a new access token from the authentication server. The refresh token is a more extended, securely stored credential that helps maintain continuous access without requiring the user to log in again.</p>
            <br />
            <h2 className='text-xl'>Where should we store them on the client-side?</h2>
            <br />
            <p className='text-md'>Access tokens and refresh tokens should be stored securely on the client-side to prevent unauthorized access or theft. Common storage options include:</p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>1. <span className='font-bold'>HTTP Cookies: </span>Cookies can be used to store tokens securely and are sent with every HTTP request to the server.</p>
            <p>2. <span className='font-bold'>Web Storage: </span>Local Storage or Session Storage in the browser are other options for token storage.</p>
            <p>3. <span className='font-bold'>In-Memory: </span>For single-page applications (SPAs), you can store tokens in memory. However, this is less secure as it exposes tokens to potential XSS attacks.</p>
            <p>4. <span className='font-bold'>HttpOnly Cookies: </span>For enhanced security, access tokens should be stored in HttpOnly cookies to prevent JavaScript access and protect against XSS attacks.</p>
