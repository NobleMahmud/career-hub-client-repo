            <h2 className='text-xl'>What is Express.js?</h2>
            <br />
            <p className='text-md'>Express.js is a minimal, unopinionated Node.js web application framework that simplifies the process of building web applications and APIs. It provides a set of features for handling routes, middleware, and HTTP requests, making it a popular choice for building back-end applications.</p>

            <h2 className='text-xl'>What is Nest.js?</h2>
            <br />
            <p className='text-md'>Nest.js is a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications. It is built on top of Express.js and provides a more structured and opinionated approach to application architecture. Nest.js leverages TypeScript and Dependency Injection to create modular, maintainable, and testable code.

            In summary, understanding access tokens and refresh tokens is crucial for secure authentication and authorization in web applications. Proper storage of tokens on the client-side is essential to maintain security. Express.js and Nest.js are two powerful frameworks for building web applications, with Nest.js offering a more structured and organized approach to application development.</p>
